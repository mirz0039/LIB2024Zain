<section> <p> <strong> Vertebrates </strong> are deuterostomal animals with a bony or cartilaginous axial endoskeleton, known as the vertebral column, around and along the spinal cord. They include all fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. A similarly derived word is vertebra, which refers to any of the irregular bones or segments of the spinal column.The word vertebrate derives from the Latin word vertebratus, meaning joint of the spine. Vertebrates (comprising nearly 70,000 species) make up less than five percent of all described animal species, with the rest being invertebrates, an informal polyphyletic group comprising all that lack vertebral columns. Existing vertebrates range in body lengths from the frog species Paedophryne amauensis to the blue whale at up to 108 feet (33 meters) and 210 tons (420,000 pounds). The vertebrates traditionally include the hagfish, which do not have proper vertebrae due to their loss in evolution. However, they do possess a cranium, making them part of the vertebrate subphylum called Craniata or "craniates." Molecular analysis since 1992 suggests that hagfish are most closely related to lampreys and are considered vertebrates in a monophyletic sense. Vertebrates are built along a chordate body plan, consisting of a rigid axial endoskeleton, a hollow dorsal nerve cord, and an elongated tail. They also have pharyngeal arches and an iodine-concentrating organ called the endostyle, which develops into the thyroid in adults. The endoskeleton extends beyond the anus and often forms an elongated tail. </p> 

<p> Vertebrates, which originated during the Cambrian explosion, include the earliest known vertebrates from the Chengjiang biota, which lived around 518 million years ago. These early vertebrates had a basic vertebrate body plan, lacked jaws, and relied on filter feeding. The Cenozoic world saw significant diversification of bony fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. About 33,600 living vertebrate species are fish, inhabiting aquatic ecosystems from Himalayan lakes to Challenger Deep. Fish are the main predators in freshwater and marine water bodies. The rest are tetrapods, including amphibians, mammals, reptiles, and birds. Tetrapods comprise the dominant megafauna in terrestrial environments and include many aquatic groups, such as sea snakes, penguins, and cetaceans. </p> </section>
